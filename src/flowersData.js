        informations: "Snapdragons are whimsical flowers named for their dragon-mouth-shaped blooms that can be 'snapped' open by squeezing the sides. These cool-season favorites symbolize grace, strength, and deception. Children delight in making the flowers 'talk' by pressing the sides to open and close the 'jaws.' Available in dwarf varieties just 6 inches tall to stately types reaching 3 feet, snapdragons offer height and vertical interest in gardens. They're particularly valuable for spring and fall blooms when temperatures are cool. The flowers grow on tall spikes, opening from bottom to top, providing long-lasting color in borders and excellent cut flowers for arrangements.",

        informations: "Petunias are popular summer annuals known for their trumpet-shaped flowers and long blooming season. Related to tobacco and tomatoes, these South American natives symbolize anger and resentment in the language of flowers, despite their cheerful appearance. Modern breeding has produced an astonishing varietyâ€”from compact mounds to trailing varieties cascading several feet, from simple single blooms to frilly doubles, and from solid colors to striped, veined, or picotee patterns. Wave petunias revolutionized landscapes with their groundcover-like spread, while more recent innovations include improved weather resistance and self-cleaning habits, eliminating the need for deadheading to keep plants blooming continuously.",

        informations: "Pansies are beloved cool-season flowers known for their 'faces'â€”distinctive markings on flat, rounded petals that resemble cheerful expressions. Developed from wild violas in the early 19th century, they symbolize loving thoughts and remembrance. Their name comes from the French word 'pensÃ©e,' meaning 'thought.' Pansies thrive in cool temperatures, making them ideal for spring and fall gardens in most climates, and winter gardens in milder regions. Available in single colors, bicolors, and tricolors, often with contrasting 'whiskers' or dark centers, these cheerful blooms brighten containers, borders, and window boxes when many other plants aren't flowering.",

It's the national flower of Pakistan and Indonesia and plays important roles in religious ceremonies and perfumery worldwide. While most jasmines are vining plants, some form shrubs, and they can be evergreen or deciduous depending on the species and climate. Common jasmine (Jasminum officinale) offers classic white blooms, while winter jasmine (J. nudiflorum) brings yellow flowers on bare stems during the coldest months, providing welcome color and fragrance.",
